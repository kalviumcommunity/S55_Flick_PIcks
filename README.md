# FLICK PICK

Flick Pick is an online website that aligns with my love for movies. Feeling lost in the endless sea of options on Netflix is a common dilemma, but fear not! I aim to create a website focussed on recommending movies to others and receiving recommendations for others, exploring films together. There will even be daily recommendations spanning across different genres like Horror, Action, Comedies and much more depending on how you feel. Let’s explore our love for movies…

### My plan for the next few days will be as follows- 

DAY 1 -> Creating React App & Designing Logo

DAY 2 -> Low-Fid Design

DAY 3 -> High-Fid Design
